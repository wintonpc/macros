ideas:
- rspec; use to test actor model
- entity definition. using different macros, expand into
  - entity struct
    - with validation
  - generative tests (using rspec clone)
  - documentation
- referee-like test DSL
  - build up entities
  - drive with rspec clone

- Week 1
  - Day 1: actor model
    - exceptions
      - fibers (example in ruby)
      - what do they have in common? continuations
      - rethink both in terms of continuations
      - give each fiber a queue
      - hide the cooperation (yield -> receive)
      - actor model
      - advantages
      - demo in scheme
      - look at code
  - Day 2: rspec
- Week 2
  - Day 3: entity definitions
- Week 3
  - Day 4: cucumber
  - Day 5: core rule tests
